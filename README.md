galaxy-tidal-tails

Scientific computing project for my third year of my physics degree, simulating and investigating the tidal tails that appear when two galaxies get close to each other. 

Running animator.py will run the simulation (should take roughly a couple of minutes) and animate the results. The simulation is of a galaxy of initially concentric rings of stars (modelled as having zero mass) orbitting one heavy central point mass. This gets close to another point mass (representing the other galaxy), and gravitational effects lead to tidal tail effects.

More detail is given in the report.
