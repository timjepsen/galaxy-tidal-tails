"# galaxy-tidal-tails" 

Scientific computing project for my third year of my physics degree, simulating and investigating the tidal tails that appear when two galaxies get close to each other. 

Running animator.py will run the simulation (takes roughly a couple of minutes) and animate the results. The simulation is of a galaxy of initially concentric rings of stars orbitting one heavy central point mass. This gets close to another point mass (representing the other galaxy), and gravitational effects lead to tidal tails effects.

More detail is given in the report.
